# Apriori-Algorithm

This is an attempt to understand Apriori algorithm. I have tried few libraries but finally decided to go ahead with mlxtend. The key is to create one-hot encoded dataset to be able to use it further in the function. This kind of analysis can be used not only at grocery store but in gaming, movie recommendation etc. Go ahead, have a look at my jupyter notebook and get satrted!
